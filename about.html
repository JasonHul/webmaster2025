                <p>
                    Nectar was born from a love for the earth and its resources. We’re more than a restaurant, we’re a celebration of sustainability, craftsmanship, and connection. Our mission is to redefine dining by creating vibrant, plant-based dishes that honor nature and nourish our community.

                <p>
                    At Nectar, sustainability is our promise. From zero-waste kitchens to compostable packaging, every choice reflects our commitment to the planet. We source locally, minimize waste, and design our space with reclaimed materials and energy-efficient systems.

                    By partnering with farmers who practice organic and regenerative agriculture, we ensure our ingredients support healthy ecosystems and thriving communities.

                <p>
                    We believe in supporting the people who grow our food. That’s why <strong>10% of our profits</strong> go directly to local farmers, helping them sustain their practices and livelihoods. Through workshops and events, we also connect our guests with the stories behind their meals, fostering a deeper appreciation for sustainable agriculture.
